How can you help the Open Teach R project?

Roughly speaking, we need two kinds of contributors (but you can be a mix of them):
 - You can help building courseware if you have some experience in using or teaching R;
 - You can help testing the material as it is being built if you want to try teaching with it, even if you never done that before.

Also, we would love to get help at leats two non R related issues:
 - I live and work in Brazil, and I would love to get all the material translated to Portuguese;
 - I would be great for this project to have a nice looking and easy to use website.
 
 You can start getting involved by saying [hi here](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/issues/1) and talking a little bit about yourself and how you can help us. And you can also (and tottaly should!) plan to join us at the [Global Sprint in June](https://mozilla.github.io/global-sprint/).
 
 More info coming soon, but you can already contact us at anytime! ;)
