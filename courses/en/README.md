Courses in English will be available inside this folder, and this readme file will be edited to add a brief description for each one of them.

There is not a closed model for a course, but as a general pointer a complete ready-to-use one should have:
 - a guide for the lecturer;
 - presentation slides;
 - data;
 - R scripts.
