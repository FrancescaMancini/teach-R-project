Hi!

I built this sample course to work both as a short and friendly introduction to R and as a small example of what kind of material a course inside the Open Teach-R Project could (or should) have.

**This course is under construction!**

I decided to add it as it is being built because I was eager to add some material, so people could come ate the project page and have something more concrete to look at. ;)

**About this course**

This is a short and introductory R course aimed at Biological Sciences students and researchers with little or no previous contact with R or Statistics. It is designed to work as a ~3 hour class, with participants actively using R as the course goes.

**Course resources:**

- instructor guide + RMarkdown source code for the guide;
- presentation slides;
- R instructions for instructor and participants + RMarkdown source code;
- databases used in the course.

*Links will be added to resources as the course is being built; if this message is still here, than the course is still under construction, and all available material is probably incomplete...*
