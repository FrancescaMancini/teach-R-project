All available courses will be organized here inside sub-folders.

The first division is the language: our starting point will most likely be English and Portuguese based courses, but other languages will be added as contributors add more material.

Further, inside each language folder, a README file will briefly describe each course and sub-folders holding the course name will give access to each set of materials.
