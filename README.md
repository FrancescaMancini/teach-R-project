# The Open Teach-R Project!

Welcome! :D

### What is it about?

R is an amazing open tool for data analysis and visualization, but it is known to have a steep learning curve for scientists and students that do not have a Computer Science background... But it gets much easier if you have the chance to learn it in a well built course aimed your own research field.

This project's mission os to build, gather and organize courseware for anyone willing to offer a R based course for biological sciences students and researchers. This way, as you get more experienced in using R, you will be able to find hands on material to teach it to your coleagues and students, helping to spread the R magic among more and more people! ;)

### How can you help?

This project is being built during [Mozilla Open Leadership Training 2017](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/), and will welcome contributors very soon. If you like using or teaching R than you can help us!

More info coming very soon, ok?
