# The Open Teach-R Project!

Welcome!

### What is it about?

R is an amazing open tool for data analysis and visualization, but it is known to have a steep learning curve for scientists and students that do not have a Computer Science background... But the good news is that it gets much easier if you have the chance to start learning it in a well built course aimed your own research field!

**Thus, this project's mission is to build, gather and organize courseware for anyone willing to offer a R based course for biological sciences students and researchers.**

### Why?

We want more people using R: it is an awesome tool for Open Science orientated research, there is already a huge community of users and developers and once the user gest used to its basic principles it turns out to be very easy to learn new techniques. To help getting more people using it we want to break the initial learning barrier, and we want do this making it easier for the more experienced users to teach R to beginners.

The idea is to create a snowball-like effect: as more scientists, lectures and students learn how to use R and get more experienced, they will be able to find hands on material to teach it, helping to spread the R open magic among more and more people!

### How can you help?

If you like using or teaching R than you can help us!

Right now this project is being built during [Mozilla Open Leadership Training 2017](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/), and will welcome contributors very soon. But if you found it to be interested, don't wait, and [feel free to say hi here](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/issues/1).

Also, you can check out the Project Roadmap, it is being built [right here](https://github.com/marcosvital/teach-R-project/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

More info coming very soon, ok?
